## 🎯 Overall Objectives
1. Understand and apply core GRC standards and frameworks (ISO, NIST, COSO, COBIT, CIS Controls)  
2. Automate compliance verification and documentation (Policy‑as‑Code, OSCAL)  
3. Build expertise milestones through industry‑recognized certifications

## 📂 Suggested GitHub Repo Structure

```

/README.md              ← this roadmap
/docs                   ← templates, OSCAL models, SoA samples
/scripts                ← Ansible playbooks, InSpec profiles, PowerShell scripts
/certs                  ← certification roadmap and tracking
/projects               ← sample GRC projects and case studies

```

> **Pro tip**: Integrate a CI pipeline (GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) that runs your InSpec/OpenSCAP checks on every pull request and publishes OSCAL‑formatted reports. This makes your GRC repo both a living showcase of Policy‑as‑Code skills and a practical compliance toolkit.
